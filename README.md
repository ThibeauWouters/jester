# JESTER - Jax-based EoS and Tov solvER

**J**ax-based **E**o**S** and **T**ov solv**ER** (JESTER) consists of a set of tools for solving the TOV equation with a given equation-of-state (EOS).

Since it is based on JAX, JESTER makes use of hardware acceleration on GPUs and TPUs. It can also be easily used together with other JAX-based software, e.g., [Jim](https://github.com/kazewong/jim).
